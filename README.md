# Maxx Films

This project is a web application developed to search and display information about movies. The main objective is to practice and improve skills in front-end development and API consumption.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Page structure.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): Responsive interface styling and design.

JavaScript (ES6 Modules): Core logic, API consumption, and dynamic interface manipulation.

## Features
Popular Movie List: Displays a list of the most popular movies.

Featured Movie: A featured section at the top with the movie title and overview.

Search Bar: Allows you to search for movies by name.

Mock Login: A modal with simple validation logic and state management using localStorage.

Modular Organization: The code is divided into different files (api.js, modal.js, config.js) to demonstrate the use of ES6 modules and good programming practices.


## How to Run the Project

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Note: To enable API functionality, you need to obtain your own TMDB API key and insert it into the config.js file.
